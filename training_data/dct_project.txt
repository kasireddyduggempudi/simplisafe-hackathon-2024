DCT - Drupal to CommerceTools
Project space for the DCT OMS Order form project. Our goal is replace the Order management, slicing functionality off from Ubercart.
The project consists of a hosted iframe react application replacing the create order screen in Drupal. The react application uses Auth0 for authentication and those credentials are passed to the backend services in place of x-vid-token where required.
Phases of the project
Phase 1 (In progress):
Accept phone orders entered via CSR’s and authorize payment to ready the order for fulfillment
Orders continue to flow into Drupal and are considered authoritative for fulfillment
As part of this we will enable:
* Fetching products from Commercetools including:
   * Components
   * Systems
   * Permits
   * Service Plans
   * Replacement parts
   * Using products created in Drupal but using product sync to import into Commercetools
* Fetching discount codes from Commercetools
   * Using coupon codes created in Drupal but using promotion sync to load Commercetools
* Implementing Zuora iframe in the React application for order authorization
* UX/UI Improvements for order management
* New customers are created in both Commercetools and Drupal
   * Leads are inserted via ecomm-leads
Phase 2 (Not exhaustive):
* Orders continue to flow into Drupal but are not considered authoritative
* Order edits are made to the Commercetools Order object and then flow down into Drupal
   * Orders not present or updated after placement will be sync’d “just in time” to Commercetools
* Order refunds are processed using Commercetools
* Products are created in Commercetools
   * Drupal will need products until reporting can be moved
   * Prices are not considered authoritative for reporting purposes if we want to enable price testing
* Promotions are created in Commercetools
* Enable price testing and changes in Commercetools
Phase 3 (High level, pending stakeholder sign-off):
* Fulfillment is done via Order objects in Commercetools
* Order splitting is handled with multiple shipments in Commercetools
* Reporting can be done via BI data fed from Commercetools
* Order data in Drupal is non-authoritative, products no longer need to be created in Drupal
   * The First Order no longer sync’s orders to Drupal
Repositories:
simplisafe/eis-orders-frontend  - EIS Orders Frontend is our react application to be hosted inside Drupal. This interacts with the EIS/Ecomm apis to facilitate order creation and management
