Installation

Prerequisites

Prerequisite tools

dex requires a few prerequisites:

bash 4+ or zsh

node.js 12+ (including npm, npx): brew install node

kubectl: brew install kubectl

Docker

In Docker Desktop settings, enable Docker Compose V2

aws CLI version 2

The saml-aws-auth credential helper we use to authenticate to AWS with Okta.

TIP

You don't need to configure AWS profiles to use dex, only ensure that you have saml-aws-auth installed.

If saml-aws-auth is installed at the default location by brew (/Applications/saml-aws-auth.app/Contents/MacOS/saml-aws-auth), dex will use it without any further configuration. If you've installed it anywhere else, you can customize the location dex uses in your dexrc file.

EKS cluster

To use dex, your team's AWS accounts must have had an EKS cluster provisioned. This can be done easily, via self-service, by doing a simple PR to our EKS clusters repo.

Required access

You must have VPN access configured

AWS authentication must be configured for any AWS accounts you'll be using. Talk with your team lead about which accounts/roles you need access to, and submit an IT ticket to get access via Okta.

Install dx

INFO

You must be on the VPN to install dx and dex!

To install dx (dex's command line app), run the following one-liner:

sudo curl --fail https://artifactory.tools.simplisafe.com/artifactory/devops-generic/dx/latest -o /usr/local/bin/dx && sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/dx && dx -v

TIP

You don't need to install dx to /usr/local/bin: anywhere on your PATH is fine. For example, if you prefer ~/.local/bin:

curl --fail https://artifactory.tools.simplisafe.com/artifactory/devops-generic/dx/latest -o ~/.local/bin/dx && chmod +x ~/.local/bin/dx && dx -v

Install shell auto-completion

It's really nice to use dx with shell auto-completion- you can type the first couple letters of a command, press tab, and the command will auto-complete. dx can install auto-completion for you:

dx install-completion

Then restart your shell (or just reload your shell profile, e.g. . ~/.bashrc).

CAUTION

If you're using zsh, and you get the following error:

/Users/{yourname}/.dx-zsh-completion.sh:16: command not found: compdef

You need to enable "compdef" by adding the following lines to the beginning of your ~/.zshrc:

autoload -Uz compinit

compinit

Install dex into a project

TIP

If you haven't used installed dex in a project before, you may want to check out the Quickstart guide first.

Change directories into your target project.

Install dex in the project with dx install-dex

Run dx scaffold
