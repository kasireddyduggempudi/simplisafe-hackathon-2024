This guide is here to help you easily get started and work smoothly in our DCT project. Brief description about DCT and Repos is mentioned here.
Access
* Request access for Commercetools, Contentful from Lumos via Okta Tile
* Request access for ecomm-qa-poweruser in AWS through Lumos
* Request access for Orders Manager and Orders Administrator in #support-auth0 slack channel. Make sure you ask for d2ct role too. Without this role, the new React application in Drupal will not be visible
Github Repos
1. Before proceeding, ensure Drupal is running locally. Follow the steps in the provided document to set up Drupal locally.
2. Clone the eis-orders-frontend repo. Follow the instructions in the README file to set up the project locally.
3. Once both steps above are completed, run the eis-orders-frontend project. Refresh the local Drupal CRM and start creating a new order.
Repos Setup
1. eis-orders
   1. Setup this repo by following the steps in the README file.
2. the-first-order
   1. The default QA environment file in the repository will connect to the QA Drupal instance and the "simplisafe-dev-1" Commercetools project (our QA environment) when operating on your localhost.
   2. Some errors leaving comments are normal, as the generated order_id may not exist in the QA environment.
   3. To overcome this, run the-first-order locally and point your React frontend environment at it: REACT_APP_ORDERS_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3093
